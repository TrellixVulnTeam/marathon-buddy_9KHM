To do:

Functionality:
        -Need to change all ints to floats in models!

        -Add signup & login routes; use these and session to replace hardcoded users/weeks/days

        -Add functionality to mark off miles as completed & subtract from miles remaining: need event to click {day.mileage_target} object; then subtract this from that # and/or add to {day.miles_completed}...what makes sense here?
                -also need to link these miles completed so they are reflected in {week.miles_completed} and {week.mileage_target} and {total}
                -would be nice to offer a way to not just click complete or not, but to adjust the number of miles for a partially completed distance

        X-Easy navigation for moving from Overall plan to Week view

        -Add ability of user to change details of plan (num weeks, miles any given week or day)

        -Add simple math checking (do your daily miles add up to weekly? Do your total miles add up to 26.2?)

        -Add a default 16-week plan (use the one I'm using)...how does this work? Where do the defaults live? Maybe I use a seed file and somehow import that when they choose it?


UI/UX:

        -Sketch design mock-up for each page

        -Add css styling
        
        -Add visual progress tracker thingy

        -Create a demo login

        -Add celebrations for milestones completed (badges, confetti, etc.)
